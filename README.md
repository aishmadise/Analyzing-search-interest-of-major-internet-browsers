# Analyzing-search-interest-of-major-internet-browsers

Brief Background: 

In the mid 1990s, the First Browser War began with Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer fighting for dominance. By 2001, Internet Explorer was the clear winner, but it was not long before the Second Browser Wars began (2004-2017). This coincided with the rise of smartphones, which emphasized the need and competitiveness for more mobile-friendly versions of browsers.

In this notebook, I analyzed the worldwide popularity of browsers over time using Google Trends.

What did I apply? 

1. Manipulation of time series data 


Conclusion: Chrome eventually took over Firefox in late 2011! I can also observe that Chrome's annual Google Trends performance in 2009 showed a positive growth while its the opposite in 2015 - a negative growth. In 2012 & 2018, the performance somewhat fluctuated and remained the same throughout the year.
